# 2048 – Java Project

### This project is an implementation of the classic game 2048 developed in Java, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and using testing techniques to ensure code quality.

## 🧩 How does the game work?

### The goal of the game is to combine blocks with the same value to reach the number 2048.
### The board is a 4x4 grid.
### On each turn, all blocks move in one direction.
### When two blocks with the same number collide, they merge and their values ​​are added together.

## The game ends when:

### There are no more possible moves (Game Over).

### The block with a value of 2048 is reached (Victory).
